# Enigma üõ°Ô∏è

A simple, encrypted C++ chat backend built for an Object-Oriented Programming project. This project is developed following a 6-day plan, focusing on clean code, modern C++, and professional development practices.

## Features
- [ ] User registration and login
- [ ] Direct, ephemeral messaging
- [ ] Simple Caesar cipher encryption for all messages

## Tech Stack
- **Language:** C++17
- **Build System:** CMake
- **Package Manager:** vcpkg
- **Core Libraries:**
    - `cpp-httplib`: For handling HTTP requests and creating the web server.
    - `nlohmann-json`: For parsing and creating JSON data structures.

## Project Structure
The core logic of the application is built around two main classes:

- **`User` Class:** Represents a user of the service. It encapsulates the `username` and a hashed `password`, providing the basic structure for user authentication.
- **`Message` Class:** Represents a single message sent between users. It contains the message `content`, the `sender`'s username, and the `recipient`'s username.

## Getting Started
